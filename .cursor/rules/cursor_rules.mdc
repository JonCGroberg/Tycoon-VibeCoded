description: Guidelines for creating and maintaining Cursor rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.
globs: .cursor/rules/*.mdc

- **Rule Structure and Maintenance**
  - Use modular, focused rule files for CI/CD, branching, AI guidance, and security.
  - Reference external docs and best practices in each rule.
  - Regularly review and update rules as new practices and tools emerge.
  - Use file references (`@filename`) and context files (e.g., `status.md`, `architecture.mermaid`) to restore context and guide AI.
  - Keep rules concise, actionable, and under 500 lines each.

- **See Modular Rules:**
  - [ci_cd.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ci_cd.mdc)
  - [branching.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/branching.mdc)
  - [ai_guidance.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/ai_guidance.mdc)
  - [security.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/security.mdc)

- **Required Rule Structure:**
  ```markdown
  ---
  description: Clear, one-line description of what the rule enforces
  globs: path/to/files/*.ext, other/path/**/*
  alwaysApply: boolean
  ---

  - **Main Points in Bold**
    - Sub-points with details
    - Examples and explanations
  ```

- **File References:**
  - Use `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` ([filename](mdc:filename)) to reference files
  - Example: [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc) for rule references
  - Example: [schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) for code references

- **Code Examples:**
  - Use language-specific code blocks
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Show good examples
  const goodExample = true;

  // ❌ DON'T: Show anti-patterns
  const badExample = false;
  ```

- **Rule Content Guidelines:**
  - Start with high-level overview
  - Include specific, actionable requirements
  - Show examples of correct implementation
  - Reference existing code when possible
  - Keep rules DRY by referencing other rules

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use bullet points for clarity
  - Keep descriptions concise
  - Include both DO and DON'T examples
  - Reference actual code over theoretical examples
  - Use consistent formatting across rules

- **Handle GitHub Issues via Branching and Pull Requests**
  - **Each issue must be addressed in a dedicated branch**
    - Branch name should match the issue number or a clear slug (e.g., `issue-123-fix-typo`)
    - Example: `git checkout -b issue-42-fix-login`
  - **Pull requests must target the `dev` branch**
    - Do not merge directly to `main` or other branches
    - Example: Open PR from `issue-42-fix-login` → `dev`
  - **Pull request title and description should reference the issue**
    - Example: `Fix login bug (#42)`
  - **Enable auto-deletion of branches after PR merge**
    - This should be set in repository settings: `Automatically delete head branches`
    - Example: After merging PR #42, branch `issue-42-fix-login` is deleted automatically
  - **No direct commits to `dev` or `main` allowed for issue resolution**
  - **Cross-reference:** See [project.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project.mdc) for CI/CD and automation requirements
  - **DO:**
    ```shell
    # Create a branch for the issue
    git checkout -b issue-101-add-feature
    # Push and open PR to dev
    git push origin issue-101-add-feature
    # Open PR: base=dev, compare=issue-101-add-feature
    ```
  - **DON'T:**
    ```shell
    # Commit directly to dev or main
    git checkout dev
    git commit -am "Fix issue #101"
    git push origin dev
    ```
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Keep branches focused on a single issue
    - Reference the issue in all related PRs
    - Ensure branch auto-deletion is enabled in repo settings
    - Use clear, descriptive branch names

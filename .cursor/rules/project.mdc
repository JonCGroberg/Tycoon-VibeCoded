- Project uses Shadcn, Jest, pnpm, tailwind, next, and react

- Always run pnpm test after finishing any set of code changes
- Dont ask to run commands, just run them
- Test coverage should be 95%

- All tests, builds, and automation must be executed via MCP servers, not just locally
- CI/CD and task management should use MCP commands and MCP infrastructure
- Verify MCP server connectivity before running automation

- Use context7 for code and documentation search and reference
- Use deebo for automated debugging and hypothesis-driven bug investigation
- Use puppeteer for browser automation and end-to-end testing where applicable
- Use sequential thinking tools for complex problem-solving, planning, and analysis
- If UI test failures cannot be solved with Jest/RTL, use Puppeteer to debug and verify UI issues
- Dont stop untill done

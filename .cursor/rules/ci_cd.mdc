- **CI/CD and DevSecOps Best Practices**
  - **Commit Early, Commit Often:** Make atomic, frequent commits. Each commit triggers automated builds and tests.
  - **Build Only Once:** Promote the same build artifact through all pipeline stages (dev, staging, prod).
  - **Automate Everything:** All builds, tests, security scans, and deployments must be automated via MCP servers and CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Security-First:** Integrate SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and IaC checks into the pipeline. No secrets in code.
  - **Test Layering:** Use fast unit tests first, then integration, then E2E. Run tests in parallel where possible.
  - **Environment Consistency:** Use containers or IaC for ephemeral, reproducible environments.
  - **Progressive Delivery:** Support canary/blue-green deployments and rollbacks.
  - **Monitor and Measure:** Track DORA metrics, pipeline health, and deployment frequency.
  - **Team Ownership:** CI/CD and security are shared responsibilities.

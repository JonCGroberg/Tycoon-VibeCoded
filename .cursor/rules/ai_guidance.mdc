- **AI/Agent Guidance**
  - **Task Breakdown:** Break work into small, testable tasks. Reference `@tasks/tasks.md` and `@docs/status.md`.
  - **Test-Driven:** Write or update tests before implementing code. Iterate until all tests pass.
  - **Dependency and Flow Analysis:** Analyze dependencies and simulate end-to-end flows before changes.
  - **Change Scope:** Limit changes to the task at hand; avoid unrelated refactors.
  - **Explain Reasoning:** For every change, explain what, why, impact, and tradeoffs.
  - **Run and Verify Tests:** Run all relevant tests and verify passing before proposing changes.
  - **Context Restoration:** Use `@status.md`, `@architecture.mermaid`, etc., to restore lost context.
  - **Security and Compliance:** Always check for security, compliance, and code quality gates before merging.
  - **Progress Tracking:** Update status files and changelogs as part of every task.

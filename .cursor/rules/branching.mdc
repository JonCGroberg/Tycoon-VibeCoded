- **Branching and PR Workflow**
  - **Branch Protection:** All main branches (`main`, `dev`, etc.) must be protected with:
    - Required PRs before merging
    - Required status checks (build, test, security, lint)
    - Required code reviews (at least 1, or CODEOWNERS for critical paths)
    - Auto-delete branches after PR merge
    - No force pushes or direct commits to protected branches
    - Use rulesets to allow bots (e.g., release bots) to bypass only as needed
  - **Branch Naming:** Use `issue-<number>-<slug>` or `feature/<slug>`, `bugfix/<slug>`, etc.
  - **PR Requirements:** PRs must reference the issue, include a clear description, and pass all checks before merge.
  - **Changelog and Status:** Update changelogs and status files as part of every PR.

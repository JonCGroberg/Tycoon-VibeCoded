- **Security and Compliance Best Practices**
  - **Security-First:** Integrate SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, and IaC checks into the pipeline. No secrets in code or config.
  - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict permissions for CI/CD, bots, and contributors to the minimum required.
  - **Credential Management:** Use secret stores for credentials and API keys. Never store secrets in code or logs.
  - **Automated Security Gates:** All PRs and merges must pass automated security checks before deployment.
  - **Vulnerability Management:** Regularly scan dependencies and containers for vulnerabilities. Patch promptly.
  - **Audit and Traceability:** Ensure all changes are traceable to an issue, PR, and user. Enable audit logging for critical actions.
  - **Compliance Automation:** Automate compliance checks (e.g., license, SBOM, regulatory) as part of CI/CD.
  - **Incident Response:** Document and automate incident response steps for security events in the pipeline.
